# Bootstrap-password-strength-meter

Simple jQuery plugin to display strength of user's password. The plugin has been
written to seamlessly work with [Twitter Bootstrap](http://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) components. The strength of
the password is calculated using the [zxcvbn](http://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn) algorithm.

Zxcvbn returns a value indicating the strength of the password the user has entered.
There are 5 possible levels with the lowest being weakest and highest strongest (it's
a zero based index, therefore 0 to 4).

Update: The `.progress-bar` element now has a HTML data attribute called 'score' which contains the Zxcvbn score.

A demo of the plugin is available [here](http://www.mttrchrds.com/github/bootstrapPasswordStrengthMeter/).

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Copy/move the minified JS file (bootstrapPasswordStrengthMeter.min.js)
from "dist" folder into your own project.
3. Link to the JS files in your own codebase. jQuery, Bootstrap and zxcvbn are
dependencies of the plugin, therefore ensure that you link to these before
bootstrapPasswordStrengthMeter in your markup (see below). The links to JS files
ought to be just before closing body tag for optimum performance.
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="bower_components/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" />
</head>
...
<script src="bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="bootstrapPasswordStrengthMeter.min.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/zxcvbn/dist/zxcvbn.js"></script>
</body>
```
4. Add a progress bar component at the same level in the DOM as your password
input using Twitter Bootstrap components. For example:
```html
<div class="form-group">
  <label for="passwordField">Password</label>
  <input type="password" class="form-control" id="passwordField" placeholder="Password">
  <div class="progress">
    <div class="progress-bar">
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```
5. Use the plugin as below. Use the password input element selector as the plugin
 selector.
```javascript
$(function() {
  $('#passwordField').bootstrapPasswordStrengthMeter({
    minPasswordLength: 4
  });
});
```
- Options are:
- `minPasswordLength` integer value which matches the minimum password length in your own validation. Default value is 6.
- `levelShortClassName` class name of the 'too short' password. Used on `progress-bar` div. Default value is `progress-bar-danger`.
- `levelShortDescription` description of the 'too short' password. Default value is `Too short`.
- `level0ClassName` class name of zxcvbn level 0 (weakest). Used on `progress-bar` div. Default value is `progress-bar-danger`.
- `level0Description` description of zxcvbn level 0 (weakest). Default value is `Weak`.
- `level1ClassName` class name of zxcvbn level 1. Used on `progress-bar` div. Default value is `progress-bar-danger`.
- `level1Description` description of zxcvbn level 1. Default value is `Not great`.
- `level2ClassName` class name of zxcvbn level 2. Used on `progress-bar` div. Default value is `progress-bar-warning`.
- `level2Description` description of zxcvbn level 2. Default value is `Better`.
- `level3ClassName` class name of zxcvbn level 3. Used on `progress-bar` div. Default value is `progress-bar-success`.
- `level3Description` description of zxcvbn level 3. Default value is `Strong`.
- `level4ClassName` class name of zxcvbn level 4 (strongest). Used on `progress-bar` div. Default value is `progress-bar-success`.
- `level4Description` description of zxcvbn level 4 (strongest). Default value is `Very strong`.
- `parentContainerClass` class selector of parent of both password and progress-bar. Used for navigating the DOM. Default value is `.form-group`.

### Customize

It's possible to easily modify or extend the BootstrapPasswordStrengthMeter plugin.
Simply download or clone the repository, the original plugin
JavaScript file is located in the "src" folder.

This file can be modified then viewed within the repo via "demo/index.html".

Using Gulp (instructions below), the source JS can be minified for distribution.

Install the NPM dependencies (assumes you already have NPM installed). Navigate
to the project root and run:
```sh
$ npm install
```

Install Gulp globally (if not already):
```sh
$ npm install -g gulp
```

Install Bower globally (if not already):
```sh
$ npm install -g bower
```

Install the Bower dependencies (Twitter Bootstrap, jQuery and zxcvbn). Navigate
to the project root and run:
```sh
$ bower install
```

To build the minified distrubution JS. Navigate
to the project root and run::
```sh
$ gulp build-js
```

## Credits

BootstrapPasswordStrengthMeter was written by Matt Richards. The plugin is based on
[Mark Dalgleigh's](http://markdalgleish.com/2011/05/creating-highly-configurable-jquery-plugins/)
popular jQuery plugin design pattern (subsequently modified by [Addy Osmani](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/10/essential-jquery-plugin-patterns/#a-highly-configurable-and-mutable-plugin)).

The password strength algorithm is based on [zxcvbn](https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2012/04/zxcvbn-realistic-password-strength-estimation/).
